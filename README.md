# Real-Time Weather Monitoring System

## Overview

This project implements a real-time data processing system to monitor weather conditions and provide summarized insights using rollups and aggregates. The system utilizes data from the [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/) to retrieve current weather information for major metros in India.

## Features

- Continuous weather data retrieval from the OpenWeatherMap API every 5 minutes.
- Conversion of temperature values from Kelvin to Celsius.
- Daily weather summaries including:
  - Average temperature
  - Maximum temperature
  - Minimum temperature
  - Dominant weather condition
- User-configurable alerting thresholds for temperature and specific weather conditions.
- Visualizations of daily weather summaries and historical trends.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm installed on your machine.
- A free API key from OpenWeatherMap. Sign up [here](https://openweathermap.org/appid).

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/weather-monitoring-system.git
   cd weather-monitoring-system
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up your API key:**
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project and add your OpenWeatherMap API key:
   ```plaintext
   API_KEY=your_openweathermap_api_key
   ```

### Running the Application

1. **Start the application:**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

2. **Access the application:**
   Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`.

### Database Setup

You can choose to store the daily weather summaries in a database. This project supports MongoDB. Ensure you have MongoDB running locally or use a cloud database service.

1. **Install MongoDB or set up a cloud database.**
2. **Connect to your database in the application code.**

### Usage

- The application will automatically retrieve weather data every 5 minutes.
- You can configure alert thresholds within the application for various weather conditions.
- Visualizations for daily weather summaries will be displayed on the main interface.

## Testing

To test the functionality, you can simulate various weather conditions and check if alerts are triggered correctly. Ensure that all features are working as expected by running the application and interacting with it.

## Bonus Features

- Additional weather parameters (e.g., humidity, wind speed) can be integrated into rollups and aggregates.
- Explore functionalities for weather forecasts retrieval and generate summaries based on predicted conditions.
